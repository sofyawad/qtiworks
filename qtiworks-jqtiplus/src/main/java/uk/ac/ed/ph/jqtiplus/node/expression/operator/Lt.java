 * The lt operator takes two sub-expressions which must both have single cardinality and have a numerical
 * base-type. The result is a single boolean with a value of true if the first expression is numerically
 * less than the second and false if it is greater than or equal to the second.
 * If either sub-expression is NULL then the operator results in NULL.
